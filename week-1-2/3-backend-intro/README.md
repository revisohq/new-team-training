# Week 2 - Backend technologies stack

The technologies that we will use to build our backend services in the Reviso team are:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** latest LTS
- **[ForrestJS](https://forrestjs.github.io/)**: a library that will enable us to setup a modular Node.js app
- **Hasura** to build the APIs, manage authentication, authorization, database migrations (and basically building the Backend-for-Frontend)
- **PostgreSQL** as our favourite DBMS
- **Test-driven development**

> _We will use the tools that we learned about last week to build our first application. [Let's get coding!]https://github.com/revisohq/demo-app)_
