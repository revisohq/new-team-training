# How to authenticate GitHub in WSL

The GitLab authentication that we set in Windows works automatically in WSL, but the GitHub one has some issues: We're not able to run git commands from VS Code in WSL. How can we solve this?

There are two ways of doing this.

The first one is to manually copy the `.ssh` folder from your Windows user to your user folder in the WSL filesystem.

Another way to do it is to use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

These are the steps to follow:

- Open a WSL command line
- Install github cli in WSL with:

  `curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg |sudo dd of=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg`

  `echo"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main"|sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list >/dev/null`

  `sudo apt update`

  `sudo apt install gh`

  (Commands taken from [the official guide](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian-ubuntu-linux-raspberry-pi-os-apt))

- Once it's installed, login with your GitHub account:

```
gh auth login
? What account do you want to log into?
  [Select GitHub.com]
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?
  [Select SSH]
? Generate a new SSH key to add to your GitHub account?
  [Select Yes]
? Enter a passphrase for your new SSH key (Optional)
  [Add passphrase if you want, I didn't because VS Code will have problems with git commands]
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI?
  [Select Login with a web browser]
```

And there you go ðŸ˜Š
