# Week 1 - DevOps

## Questions first

- How do you deploy your software? Is it on-premise?
- Do you already know Gitlab?

## Devops

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
